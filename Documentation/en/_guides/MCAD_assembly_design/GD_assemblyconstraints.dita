    <title>Assembly Constraints</title>
    <conbody>
        <p>Assembly constraints are ordinary 3D Constraints, that link faces and edges of bodies to
            represent the components of an assembly. You can link 3D Constraints at the top-level
            and at the subcomponents level.</p>
